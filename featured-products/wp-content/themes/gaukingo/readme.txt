== Description ==
Gaukingo is my third WordPress theme, written especially and with lots of love for my son Lucas. Lucas likes travel, music and photography and he's always on the move, so his theme was designed to put content in front and by taking the mobile-first approach, so it is fully responsive . It is accesibility ready and features the full range of post formats, two menu locations, two sidebars and three footers.



* Mobile-first, Responsive Layout
* Custom Header
* Social Links
* Post Formats
* The GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool.
